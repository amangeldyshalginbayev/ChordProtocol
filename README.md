Team members:
Amangeldy Shalginbayev, Mihhail Mati≈°inets, Dariya Nagashibayeva

For convenience we highly recommend using PyCharm IDE to run the code. There is Free Community Edition for any platform. You can download and install it here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

To run chord protocol simulation, open the project in PyCharm and run main_protocol_simulation/main.py file. Alternatively, you can run via command line python3 main_protocol_simulation/main.py. While simulation runs, you can see simulation results in real time: adding nodes, querying for keys between nodes, etc
