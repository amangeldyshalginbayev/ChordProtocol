For convenience we highly recommend using PyCharm IDE to run the code. There is Free Community Edition for any platform. You can download and install it here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

To run chord protocol simulation, open the project in PyCharm and run main_protocol_simulation/main.py file. Alternatively, you can run via command line python3 main_protocol_simulation/main.py. While simulation runs, you can see simulation results in real time: adding nodes, querying for keys between nodes, etc

<b>Experiment to count number of steps in key query and plot the results:</b></br>
Run experiment_count_query_steps/main.py file to run protocol simulation. Then run experiment_count_query_steps/result_dump/collate_csvs.py to collect experiment results and save in csv format. Then run experiment_count_query_steps/plot_count_matrix.ipynb to plot results.
