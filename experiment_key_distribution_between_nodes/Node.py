class ChordNode:
    ''' A single Node on the Chord Ring. Each Node contains the following:
        ID:             Hashed ID of the Node.
        pred_ID:        ID of the Node that preceeds itself.
        finger_table_i: ith entry of the finger table. 
        next:           Index that keeps track of next finger table entry to update
        storage:        Dictionary that holds the keys and values of the items it stores.
        succ_list:      Successor list, of size r-1. Contains the subsequent successors AFTER
            the first one, which is already stored in finger_table_0

    Furthermore, each Node contains the following:
        func:          A dictionary that makes function names to actual Node functions themselves.
        joined:        A boolean to keep track of whether the Node has joined the ring yet. 
            Only set to True once it's successor has been determined.
        incoming_RPCs: A queue of RPCs that the node needs to process. For more information
            on RPCs, view the README document.
        counter:       countains (operation_count, offset). Used as a proxy for time to determine
            when to fix finger and stabilize. The offset is randomly generated to make sure
            that not all Nodes are trying to fix finger and stabilize at the same itme.
        message_counter:  incremented every time an RPC is added to another node's list
